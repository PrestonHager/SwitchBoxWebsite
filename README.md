# Switch Box

Switch Box is a tile based game for iOS.
There are two tiled boards on the screen, one is the playable area, the other is the goal.
Each tile holds a different type of box.
To win a round, the user must move the boxes in the playable area around until it matches the goal board.
Moving boxes is simple.
Create a path by dragging a box around.
Let go of the box and it will move through the path and displace the other boxes until its destination.
